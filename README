TaskGraph to TimedAutomata 

This project converts TaskGraph definitions written in the 
Standard Task Graph Set (STG) format 
(http://www.kasahara.cs.waseda.ac.jp/schedule/) and converts them into 
UPPAAL timed automata (www.uppaal.org).

Dependencys:

The code uses the Timed Automata Libary distributed together with TAPAAL 
(www.tapaal.net) for generation of UPPAAL XML files.
